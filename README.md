 Algorithms Used:
  After much deliberation and trying different algorithms, we chose Lasso regression for our modelling, for the following reasons:
 It takes care of regularization of the data without compromising on the confidence of the model output
 It act as hyper parameter by making the least or not required coefficients to zero
 It provides a stable and robust model as compared to other algorithms
 It is quick to implement as compared to other algorithms

 Our r2 score is nearly 90s for both Train and Test data
